🛏️ Sleep Efficiency Prediction using Machine Learning
This project analyzes and predicts sleep efficiency based on various physiological and behavioral factors using machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as sleep duration, deep sleep percentage, caffeine/alcohol consumption, exercise frequency, and more.

📂 Dataset
Source: Sleep_Efficiency.csv

Target Variable: Sleep efficiency

The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, with some missing values that are handled in preprocessing.
